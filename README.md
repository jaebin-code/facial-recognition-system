# facial-recognition-system
facial recognition system by using Arduino and RaspberryPi

# Explain
Through the facial recognition system, when the image corresponding to the correct answer passes, a green light comes on, and if it is not the correct answer, a red light comes on.

The machine learning model must be created using a teachable machine, and you can run it right away by simply creating it and putting it in a folder.

When the button is pressed, facial recognition is executed, and the light flashes according to the result.
